Building a semi supervised learning algorithm which takes in 10% of the instances with labels and tries to maximize the classification accuracy using EM technique.

The base classification algorithm is SVM.

To run the program place the feature vector file in the sklearn_mode/files/.

cd sklearn_model/python

run python datamodeller <trainingfile> <testingfile> <traininglabel>
